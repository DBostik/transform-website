Variety is the spice of life! Stay on track with your health and fitness goals, but switching things up a bit from time to time, especially when it comes to what you’re eating. If you keep eating the same things over and over again, you’re likely to get bored and fall off the wagon; however, switching things up keeps the journey fresh!

Check out this yummy Vegan Breakfast recipe for Apple Buckwheat Pancakes with Coconut Caramel Apples. Thanks to Nicholas Elliot for providing this awesomeness! It tastes so yummy and it was super easy to make.

# DIRECTIONS

Start by gathering, preparing and measuring all of the ingredients. This will improve your dynamic in the kitchen.


#

#


## PANCAKE BATTER

1. Start by preparing your flax egg by mixing 1 tbsp ground flax seeds and 3 tbsp water. Let it rest for 5 minutes while you sift or whisk together all of the dry ingredients.

2. Sift or whisk together all the dry ingredients in a medium mixing bowl.

3. After 5 minutes, your flax egg will be ready to use — mix it in your almond milk and gently fold them into your dry ingredients. Be careful not to over-mix the batter.

4. Let the pancake batter rest for 15 minutes while you peel and chop the apple.

5. Once the batter has rested for 15 minutes, fold in an additional 2 tbsp almond milk, the melted coconut oil and the chopped apple.

#


## TO MAKE THE PANCAKES

1. Place a few drops of coconut oil on a good quality non-stick frying pan on low-medium heat and spread with the help of a kitchen paper towel. This is all the oil you will need. In between pancakes, rub the same paper towel on the pan.

2. With the help of a measuring cup, fill a 1/4 cup (60 ml) with pancake batter and place on the heated frying pan.

3. Allow to cook for 2 or 3 minutes until bubbles start popping on top.

4. Flip the pancake over with a spatula and cook for about 2 more minutes.

#


## COCONUT CARAMEL APPLES

1. In a non-stick frying pan, melt the coconut oil and add the coconut sugar, cinnamon and water.

2. Mix and allow to combine into smooth caramel sauce.

3. Add the apple wedges and cook until soft and warm.

Serve the caramel apples over the pancakes and enjoy! If you’ve got leftover pancakes don’t worry, just store them in an airtight container in the fridge and reheat them later. They will taste just as great.
