If truth be told, most of us want to be a lot fitter than we are. It is something we should all be aiming for, a better level of fitness.

So, where do you start? A quick internet search reveals too many pages to provide a good and reliable source of information, and there is a great deal of information provided on the TV channels, books, newspapers and countless fitness DVDs.

To be honest there will always be something out there that will help, or maybe you can take a little information from each one to build your own fitness regime. Better idea, find a personal trainer to guide you on your quest for fitness.

Being fitter equals less body fat as this is something that is burnt off during exercise. You could just diet to become slimmer but your chances of losing weight will be much greater if you exercise as well.

A fitter person has a lower heart rate which improves your well being and as you will be breathing harder during exercise this will increase your lung function so you will enable your body to absorb more oxygen to feed your brain and muscles.

If you have hypertension, being fitter can help to lower this and can positively affect both diastolic and systolic levels. This has helped people suffering from hypertension especially those taking medications since one of the side effects of those meds has been to lower the heart rate.

A lower heart rate means less oxygen circulating round the body, and less oxygen means less brain food. This explains why some days, these people have been slightly confused and somewhat forgetful. Raising your overall fitness level and working out can help in this condition.

Being fitter can also have a positive effect on cholesterol levels, reducing LDL cholesterol, (which is good), yet helping to raise the HDL level, (which is also good). Greater fitness can also help your heart and lower the chance of having a stroke.

Your stamina and strength can significantly increase when you start working out and this is even more important to people as you get a little older. Aging can have great effects on how your body works so it is crucial that you keep on moving and stay active.
