There is no better way to create a bond with your special someone than by focusing on your fitness goals together.

Research has shown that couples who workout together are more likely to train longer and harder than when they go at it solo.

Whether you like to head to the gym or head outdoors, there are many exercises and activities that can be participated in as a duo.

Pump Some Iron Together :

Personal trainers in Chicago say, “Have your partner spot you when you are lifting free weights in the gym to be sure you aren’t taking on too much weight. This encourages eye contact and communication between the two of you.”  Have your partner watch your form and tell them to be vocal when they see any mistakes you may be making.

Go Rock Climbing:

This power activity is also good for communication, and it allows you both to show literal support.  During your climb, tell your partner to be your second set of eyes while you are trying to get a grip on that next step.

Play Tennis:

If you both have a competitive streak, grab some racquets and a few balls and hit the court.  Tennis offers cardio while sharpening hand-eye coordination.  If you have a set of competitive friends, play a few games of doubles, the teamwork between you and your partner can be very beneficial for the relationship.

Use Your Body Weight:

If it’s Sunday afternoon and both of you want a great workout, but don’t want to leave the house, using nothing but your bodyweight to rotate between sets of pushups, squats, jumping jacks, and sit-ups is a great way to bond and have fun while getting the exercise you need.

Go For A Run:

Cardo is always better when you have a partner.  If you plan to go to the gym, run on two treadmills that are located side-by-side so you can keep the conversation going.  An outdoor run can be even more fun, especially if you treat yourselves to some sweet companionship with a destination date for afterwards.

Go Salsa Dancing:

This spicy set of dance moves combines physical activity with an atmosphere that is romantic in nature.   Many Chicago personal training studios offer classes, or you can just hit the town and learn alongside performing dancers in a local salsa dance hall.  The physical contact along with the music is sure to keep both of you close for the duration of the workout.

Working with a partner offers more encouragement when you’re feeling tired and it’s also a great way to strengthen trust and communication in your relationship.

So, the next time you are looking to achieve that fitness high, get pumped with the help of someone you love.
