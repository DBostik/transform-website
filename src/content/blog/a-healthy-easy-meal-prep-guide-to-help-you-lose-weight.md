You work hard to keep in shape and look as good as you can. But what about the food you put into your body? A simple meal prep guide might be all you need to go to get started on your weight loss goals.

Most of us want to lose weight. In fact, it’s estimated that over 160 million Americans are overweight or obese.

While regular exercise can go a long way in weight loss, eating the right foods are equally important no matter what your goals are.

But who has time to meal plan, shop and cook every day?

Success keeps you motivated. So we’ll walk you through, in detail, a full 7 days of breakfasts, snacks, lunches, and dinners. After your first 7 days, you’ll have a great idea on how to continue. Now let’s dive in.


#

# Planning Ahead

If you’re short on time, it’s a great idea to prepare certain dishes, sides, and condiments ahead of time. If you have a few hours on Sunday afternoon, it’s a perfect time to do some prepping work to save you time later in the week.

If you’re not the type to pre-prep, don’t worry.
