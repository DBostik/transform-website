But I’m only eating 1,500 calories per day…  LOOK! ⁠You may or may not track everything  you consume but just know, your body DOES. Just imagine… you are working your butt off. However, after hitting wall after wall, failure after failure, you realize the thing that is holding you back from SUCCESS is those “little” extra bites. THAT SUCKS!

DOESN’T IT?!? One extra bite may not seem like much individually, but added up over time can be that difference needed. All of those extra bites add up so be completely truthful with your food tracking.

# What To Do

Who doesn’t indulge in those extra bites sometimes? This isn’t to beat yourself up over, but this is more to help you be HONEST with yourself. So wait to indulge in those untracked “extra” bites when you are in your MAINTENANCE STAGE vs.

when you are in your WEIGHTLOSS STAGE.⁠ Staying true to your⁣ daily calorie allowance by entering ALL of the things you eat and drink (and I mean EVERY LITTLE BITE and SIP). With HONESTY you CAN achieve your goals and you absolutely DESERVE it! You GOT this…
