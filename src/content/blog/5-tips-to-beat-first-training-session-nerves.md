Nervous about your first Chicago personal training session?  Don’t be!  Here are some tips that will help center your mind and calm you down before it finally arrives.

one

Drink plenty of water the night before and the day of your first meeting with your trainer.  You don’t want to feel dehydrated during exertion and keep having to excuse yourself to grab a drink of water.  You want to be able to give your trainer your undivided attention so you can grasp the important techniques he is teaching you.

two

Give yourself plenty of time to get ready before the first session so you will be at your appointment on time. It could throw your trainers workout plan way off track, and you as well, if you show up late.  If you arrive in plenty of time for a proper warm-up before your session starts, you and your Chicago personal trainer are much more likely to be in sync.

three

Be sure to choose comfortable workout clothing and shoes for your first session. Pick out clothing that fits properly and that allows your body to stretch and move. Tops that ride up and show too much skin might make you feel like everyone is looking at you and shoes that pinch are going to keep you from reaching your full potential.

It’s important that your workout clothing is comfortable, so you will be too.

four

Get a good night’s sleep before the day of your first session with your trainer.  Your performance in the gym depends on how many hours of winks you can get.  Sleep helps recover the body from a good workout.  Plus, showing up sleepy for a training appointment will hold you back from getting the most out of your workout.

five

Prepare to answer your trainers questions about your diet and current exercise routine. Your trainer will need to know what your eating habits are like and how much exercise you are getting to create a workout plan that works for you as an individual.  Review these things while you are driving or walking to your appointment to keep your mind off of the nerves.

All in all, you should trust the trainer you hired to get your glutes into shape.  Ask questions and tell your trainer what you feel are your weak points.  He or she wants to help.
