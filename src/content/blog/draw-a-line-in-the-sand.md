My job as a coach is to interrupt what you’ve done up until this point. I think we can both agree, what got you here won’t get you any further. It’s my job to help break shackles. Sometimes that requires tough love. Things I say will be tough to read, even harsh at times. Exercises I give you will be difficult to do and feel painful.

Good. That means I’m doing my job and you’re doing exactly what you need to be doing at the moment. Do not, however, under any circumstance, run away from the challenge. Instead, run toward it. Right here right now we’re going to go over the key decision you must make. It’s time to draw a line in the sand.

# Things In Common

The one thing that PEOPLE WITH DREAMS ABOUT BEING FIT AND LIVING A HAPPY, HEALTHY LIFE have in common… Each one at some point made the decision once and for all that they were done playing games. They’re done settling for less. They’re done looking in the mirror and being unsatisfied.

They’re done sitting on the sideline watching other people who are not as bright, talented, or as passionate enjoy being happy, as well as looking and feeling healthy and fit. Here’s what they did:

- They decided to stop making excuses and playing the victim.

- They decided to they wanted to take charge of their life even if it meant getting uncomfortable.

- They decided to put in the time and energy to make their dreams come true.

They drew a line in the sand and have not looked back since. They decided that what they wanted was far more important than staying in their comfort zone. They got crystal clear on their vision, determined how to get it, determined what sacrifices would be made in order to get it, and they took massive action towards their goals until they were achieved.

# What About You?

Let’s talk about you. Tell me:

- Have you had this same conversation with yourself? Have you drawn a line in the sand?

- Have you made the decision to grow up and get serious with your health?

- Have you made the decision to stop blaming other people?

- Have you made the decision to stop running away from fear?

- Have you made the decision to resolve and let go of the anger and pain that haunts you and drives your binge eating and self destructive habits?

- Have you made the decision to take 100% responsibility for your life?

- Have you made the decision to love yourself?

- Have you? Well, look around you. Results don’t lie. It’s a Yes or No answer.

I don’t judge your responses. However, I am here to help you draw a line in the sand and make a change so you can live the life you want and deserve.

# The Sad Truth

The sad truth is that far too many people have not had this conversation with themselves and as a result, they are not in the driver’s seat of their life or their health. See…

- You will become happier and a more pleasant person to be around when you decide to become dedicated to your goals.

- You will stop feeling negatively about yourself when you decide to stop repeating the habits and tendencies that got you to where you are.

- You will be a better friend, family member, employee, etc. when you decide to be a better version of yourself.

- You will fit into your pants when you decide to lose weight and fit into your pants.

The point I’m trying to make here is that everything you are, do, and become is driven by a decision, and until you decide to commit your life to excellence, your results will never be in alignment to your intentions. Then and only then will you give yourself a shot to building the life of your dreams in the body of your dreams. It’s your turn. Time to draw a line in the sand.
