Let’s face it, as we age, certain things seem to become harder and harder to do. Squatting down to pick up something off the floor for most people was much easier at the age of 25 than at the age of 55; however, it doesn’t have to be that way. Are you one of those people struggling and feeling stiff lately?

If so, you definitely need to read on and do the following. You’re probably forgetting (or choosing) not to do mobility work or anything else to improve your flexibility. Well my friends, hate to break it to you, but stretching is ESSENTIAL no matter what age you are! Neglect it now, and you’ll pay for it later.

# Stretching for Health

As I just said above, stretching is essential to your health. According to health professionals at Harvard “Stretching keeps the muscles flexible, strong, and healthy, and we need that flexibility to maintain a range of motion in the joints. Without it, the muscles shorten and become tight. Then, when you call on the muscles for activity, they are weak and unable to extend all the way.”

Stretching has several benefits:

- Increases flexibility

- Improves mobility

- Decreases the chances of injury

- Reduces post-workout soreness

- Better range of motion

# Pre and Post Workout Stretching

Take time to stretch a little bit each and every day, especially on the days you plan to workout. Stretching is essential both as a warm up before a workout as well as afterwards. On workout days, take a 3-5 minutes (or longer if necessary) to warm up to get your muscle ready. Then, take at least 3-5 minutes to cool down and stretch.

And of course afterwards, make sure to drink plenty of water. The water and stretching will help flush the lactic acid out of your system and reduce soreness.

With that being said, make sure to stretch out all of the muscle groups you are going to or did use during the workout. It also can’t hurt to stretch other muscle groups. Most people stretch their lats, hamstrings, quads, biceps, pecs, and abs; however, it’s important to also stretch neglected areas. Don’t forget to include the following muscles too:

- triceps

- lower back

- traps

- obliques

- calves

- deltoids

- forearms

- shoulders

- neck

- glutes

Again, I cannot express this enough… stretching is essential. Take the extra couple of minutes to stretch pre AND post workout.

# Importance of Daily Stretching

Stretching isn’t just for those participating in regular exercise. EVERYONE should stretch at least to maintain or increase their flexibility and mobility regardless if you are 15 or 50. Think back to elementary, junior high, and high school gym class, P.E. teachers included stretching in there for a reason.

It’s because they understand the importance stretching and what the long term affects. Staying limber will help you with daily tasks like:

- squatting down to pick something up off the floor

- getting on the floor (and back up) to play with kids

- bending over to get your shoes on and off

- being able to get in and out of your tub safely

- carrying the laundry basket up and down stairs

## Yoga

If you keep neglecting to stretch at home independently, then it’s time to consider adding a little yoga into your routine. There are a variety of types of yoga. I’ve tried bikram (hot yoga) and vinyasa yoga, 60 minute sessions and 90 minute sessions. Personally, I like the 60 minute bikram yoga sessions, but that’s just my personal preference.

Try a couple different versions until you find what you like best.

Going to a yoga class will hold you accountable to making sure that you do stretch on a regular basis. Plus, it’s a great way you ensure all of your muscle groups are stretched properly.  In addition, it’s a great way to meet more people and keep your social and emotional health in balance too.

## For My Young Readers

For the young audience members who just read that and think that none of this applies to them… well, I hate to break it to you, but your body will change as you get older no matter what. That’s just part of the process. However, you are not doomed to become a deteriorating mass. You have the ability to determine the fate of your health. Start now.

Stretching is not just an old people thing. It’s an everybody thing.

## For My “Experienced in Life” Audience

To those who think “It’s too late for me.” Kick that thought of your head and never let it back in. There is no such thing as too late. There is such a thing as too lazy though. We all have the same 24 hours in day. You choose how you spend those 24 hours. If you have time to sit here and read this article like you’re doing right now, then you have the time to get your butt up and stretch.

It’s just a matter of priorities. If you haven’t figured it out yet, your health should be


#1. Therefore, MAKE THE TIME. It might mean getting up a little earlier or watching one less episode of your favorite Netflix series. Short term pain for a long term gain my friends.

Whatever you reason and whatever your age, get up and go stretch! Your present and future self will thank you.
