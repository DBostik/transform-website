You may not be overweight or malnourished, but that in no way means that you’re physically fit. Find out what you don’t know about fitness as shared by personal trainers in Chicago from Transform Personal Training . The tips in this article will turn you on to many different tactics you can use to achieve your ultimate goal of being fit.

Do not forget to do your cardio. Even if you are trying to just build muscle to your frame, cardio is essential. It adds some variety to your workout. It keeps your body limber and doesn’t allow your muscles to settle into a routine. Over time, it is also a great way to build lean muscle.

In order to maximize your fitness potential, be sure to lightly exercise sore muscles the next day. This will allow blood to flow into the muscles at a much higher rate, therefor speeding up the healing process. Be sure to do more repetitions, but at a lighter weight or lighter strain.

To get the most benefit out of your strength training, incorporate stretches into your routine. At least one scientific study suggests that if you pause after training your muscles and spend 20-30 seconds stretching out whatever muscle (or set of muscles) it is you’ve been working, this will increase your strength.

A goal is a great thing to have in a fitness scheme. Remember that achieving a goal is, above all, an opportunity to set a new goal. Fitness is, overall, a goal for life, not for a brief time. After climbing to a peak that has been focused on, selecting the next, higher peak to tackle will keep a regimen aimed towards life-long fitness.

One way to ensure a safe fitness routine is to make sure that you have fully recovered from the previous day, before attempting your new workout. This can be done by measuring your morning resting heart rate and comparing it to your normal resting heart rate. If it is considerably higher than normal, you need more rest.

When working out, be sure to wear comfortable, well-fitting shoes. Wearing shoes that are too tight, too big or that put uncomfortable pressure on any area of your foot will cause interuptions in your work-out routine and could even cause injury. Many aerobic and cross-training shoes provide adequate support for a wide variety of athletic activities.

Skinny never means fit, so don’t make the mistake of believing you’re fit just because you’re not noticeably unfit. True fitness comes through a proper diet and plenty of hard work. If you follow the tips shared by some of the best personal trainers in Chicago at Transform Personal Training , then  you can be well on your way to actually becoming a fit individual.
