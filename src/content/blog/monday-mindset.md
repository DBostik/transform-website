Monday: new week, new day, new chance to do something amazing.

Didn’t eat as healthy 🍔 as you had planned or get in all your workouts last week 😬?

It happens. We’re human. Don’t dwell on it.

🤓📕 Learn from your mistake(s) and move on. Can’t change the past, but you can control what happens now and going forward ⏩.

Focus on making a small positive change this week. Small changes over time lead to BIG results 😉

Maybe last week you only worked out once 👟. This week workout at least twice.  Last week you stuck to your diet 4 out of 7 days. This week aim for 5 out of 7. Over time these small improvements will add up. Stay focused. Don’t give up. Get gritty and persevere. Hard work and consistency will get you to your goals.

I can tell you from personal experience how rewarding it is to conquer your health and fitness goals. When I started my journey at 346 pounds, I was doubtful that I could drop over 100 pounds, but with a lot of hard work, determination, healthy eating, and consistency, I did it. Check out my before/after photo to see.

I’m not the only one who’s persevered and seen great result. Check out these folks. They stuck with it and hit their goals. Do same and it will work for you too!

Stay strong! 💪
