Do you consider macronutrients (a.k.a. macros) distribution in all of your meals? The good news is it’s incredibly easy to follow macro splits or simply make sure you are eating the right amount of each on a plant based diet. Macros are an energy source that provide valuable nutrients to support everyday bodily functions.

Protein and carbohydrates both provide 4 calories per gram, while fat is a denser energy source; fat provides  9 calories per gram.

# PROTEIN SOURCES

The body needs protein to maintain its structure as well as function properly. It’s most well known role is in muscle growth and repair. Protein is made up of individual amino acids. These are present in almost all foods in varying quantities.

If you consume enough overall calories everyday from a variety of food sources, you will meet your protein requirements quite easily. Here are some protein-rich foods: chicken, turkey breasts, salmon, pork tenderloin, lean cuts of beef, and eggs.

# CARBOHYDRATE SOURCES

Carbohydrates (a.k.a. carbs) are your body’s prominent and preferred energy source. Both the brain and body rely on adequate carbohydrates to function efficiently. The quality, form and function of carbs can vary drastically, which is why it’s best to consume complex carbohydrates from whole grains and starchy foods.

Some good  examples are brown rice, whole wheat pasta, oats, potatoes, and quinoa.

# FAT SOURCES

Fat comes in a variety of forms. Some are incredibly healthful while others can contribute to poorer health outcomes. It’s important to focus largely on the healthy fats, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, instead of saturated and trans fats.

In case you didn’t know, saturated fats and trans fats are predominantly found in animal products and processed foods. Healthy fats (monounsaturated and polyunsaturated) support cell structure, normal brain functioning and cognition, vision, immunity, as well as protect against cardiovascular disease.
