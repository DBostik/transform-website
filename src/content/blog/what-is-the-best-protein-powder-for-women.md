Protein powder isn’t just for bodybuilding bros and buff gym rats with bulging biceps and linebacker traps. This misconception makes some women think that protein powder isn’t for them.

However, protein powder isn’t just a great way to help you build muscle. It can also be a great addition to any weight loss or diet plan because of its ability to keep you feeling full for longer.

With all of the different types of protein powder out there, how can you know which is the best protein powder for women specifically? While everyone is different, we are going to go through some of the best protein powders women can use to supplement their diet.


#

# Whey Protein

Whey is the queen of the best protein powder for women. Whey protein is probably the most popular protein isolate used in protein powders, and for good reason.

Whey is a protein isolated from milk. Research shows that whey helps you build muscle and lose fat when added to your regular diet. Whey protein also has a number of positive effects on your health, including antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiviral qualities.

When it comes to whey protein in protein powders, there are two subtypes: whey concentrate and whey isolate.

# Whey Concentrate

Whey concentrate is most commonly used in basic protein powders. It’s inexpensive, which can be good for those of you looking to add protein to your diet on a budget.

However, many people report that whey concentrate is hard to digest, which can cause gas, bloating, and discomfort.

#


# Whey Isolate

Whey isolate might be the way to go in terms of the best protein powder for women. Each serving contains a high concentration of nutrients and amino acids that will help you build muscle while also helping you slim down.

Whey isolate is absorbed quickly, which means digestion won’t be an issue. Whey isolate protein powders are also low-carb, which is a plus for those on low-carb and weight loss diets.

# Whey Protein Powder Options

Many big name whey protein powders contain high amounts of sweeteners, flavoring, and artificial junk. Going with simple, lightly or non-flavored, high-quality powders will be best for women’s health.

Bob’s Red Mill Whey Protein Powder is unflavored and contains only two ingredients: whey protein and sunflower lecithin. This ensures you’re getting only what you want out of a protein powder without any artificial chemicals.

Bob’s Red Mill is a whey protein concentrate product, so let’s give you a whey isolate option. Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey is a great tasting, low-carb, whey isolate protein powder that provides quality protein in each serving.

# Casein Protein Powder

Casein, like whey, is a milk-derived protein. Unlike the fast absorbing whey protein, casein is very slow to be absorbed. This means it will keep you feeling full over a long period of time, and it can even be used to substitute a meal.

A study also showed that supplementing casein into your diet was more effective than low-fat diets for weight loss and control.

Casein also has a high concentration of glutamine, which can help boost your immune system.

Ascent Native Fuel Micellar Casein is a great brand of casein protein to consider. In just over 100 calories, a serving of this protein powder can give you 25 grams of protein. It contains all the essential amino acids and all natural ingredients.

# Egg Albumin Protein Powder

Both whey and casein come from milk, which can be an issue for people who are allergic or intolerant to milk. In fact, it’s estimated that 75% of the world population is lactose intolerant, meaning that digesting milk and milk proteins is difficult, or impossible, for them.

If this sounds like you, or if you’re on a dairy-free diet, you can try egg albumin as a protein source. Besides being a great protein source, albumin also contains essential vitamins. It’s also cholesterol-free, fat-free, and low-carb, which is great for women’s health.

Albumin is the main protein found in egg whites. Many people simply eat or cook with egg whites to get this protein source.

However, there are powdered forms of albumin as well. Naked Nutrition Egg White Protein Powder contains just two ingredients (Non-GMO egg white and sunflower lecithin). It’s also certified gluten free, soy free, dairy free, and free of any artificial chemicals and sweeteners.


#

# Plant-Based Protein Powder

All of the options we’ve gone through so far are derived from animal products. This means they are not suitable for people on a vegan diet or those who are allergic to dairy and/or eggs.

The good news is plant-based protein powder options have skyrocketed in recent years. The growth of plant-based protein powder market was 14.7% in 2014, which is double that of animal-based protein powders.

Plant-based protein can come from a number of sources, including:

- Soy

- Peas

- Hemp

- Brown Rice

- Nuts and Seeds

- Quinoa

Plant-based protein powders provide high protein content along with essential amino acids and nutrients. Many plant-based protein powders also contain fruit and veggie powders, which can add key nutrients and vitamins to your diet. The natural fiber found in plants will aid in digestion as well.

Vega Clean Protein could be considered the best protein powder for women. It’s certified vegan and gluten-free while providing you with a hefty 25 grams of protein and 4 grams BCAAs per serving. It also has a high iron content, which has been shown to be important for women’s health.

# The Best Protein Powder for Women: Wrapping Up

Do you want an inexpensive way to add protein to your diet? Then whey is your best bet. Are you a vegan who wants to make sure you’re getting sufficient protein and nutrients? Go for a plant-based protein powder. Do you have trouble digesting milk, but still want a powder to help you gain muscle? Try albumin.
