Check out this yummy vegetarian-friendly bowl recipe for a Grits with Avocado and Baked Tofu Strips. This grits bowl is almost like a deconstructed breakfast sandwich. Eggy baked tofu, fresh avocado, and creamy, steamy grits. It tastes so delicious! We had this the other day. Not only is it healthy and tasty, but it is super easy to make too!

PREP & COOK TIME: 45 minutes

SERVINGS: 4


#

# INGREDIENTS

- 1 block extra firm tofu – sliced into strips

- 1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce

- 1 teaspoon turmeric

- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder

- 1 tablespoon olive oil

- 4 servings grits – You’re going to follow package directions here.

- enough water – to make your grits, according to package directions

- 1/2 cup nutritional yeast

- 2 tablespoons vegan margarine, olive oil, or coconut oil

- 1 Haas avocado – sliced

- toppings of your choice – I used a handful of sliced grape tomatoes and a bit of chopped green onion.

- salt and pepper – to taste

# DIRECTIONS

1. Preheat the oven to 425F.

2. Whisk together the soy sauce, turmeric, onion powder, and olive oil to make your marinade. Toss the marinade with the tofu strips, and let them sit for at least 15 minutes. If you like, you can make these the night before, so they’ll be ready to rock in the morning.

3. Arrange your tofu strips on a baking sheet lined with a Silpat. Bake for 15 minutes, flip the strips, and bake for 15 minutes more.

4. While the tofu is baking, prepare your grits. Try to time this so the grits finish cooking around the time that the tofu is done. When you start depends on whether you’re using instant, quick, or old-school grits. Don’t forget that you need to allow a few extra minutes for water to boil, if you’re making them on the stovetop!

5. When the grits are ready, stir in the nutritional yeast and margarine, and divide between 4 bowls.

6. Top each bowl with 1/4 of the baked tofu strips, 1/4 of the avocado, and 1/4 of the tomatoes. Salt and pepper those bowls, and serve!
