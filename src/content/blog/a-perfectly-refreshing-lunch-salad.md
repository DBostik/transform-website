Listen carefully. I’m going to share with you one of the secrets to success on a fitness journey towards improved health…. It’s VARIETY. Switching up your mix of healthy recipes is super important. Over the years we’ve noticed that the people who tend to fall off the wagon get bored with what they are eating.

With that said, today I have a perfectly refreshing lunch salad recipe to add to your healthy meals arsenal.

This vegetarian meal is easy to make, packs great flavor, and can be served either hot or cold (honestly, I prefer it served cold, but it’s simply a matter of personal preference). This recipe for Pesto Spaghetti Squash Salad went over really well with everyone in my house, including my toddler.

Ideal time to have it is lunch for couple different reasons: it’s refreshing and aligns with the way we time our meals and food groups with our clients. Not sure what I meant by that last part? Send me a message. I’m happy to explain further to clear up any confusion.

- 2-3 cups fresh basil leaves

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Cut the spaghetti squash in half, and scoop out the seeds. Run water over the insides of the squash.

2. Place both halves in a 9×13 Pyrex dish with 1 inch water. Place the squash face down inside dish. Microwave for 15 minutes. (Beware, the dish will be extremely HOT. Use oven mitts or a towel to take it out of the microwave).

3. Set aside the Pyrex dish and allow to cool. Then, place it in the fridge for at least 15 minutes.

4. In a food processor, combine the basil leaves, pine nuts, and garlic. Combine while you drizzle in the olive oil. Add the lemon juice and a dash of salt. Once a paste forms, remove from food processor.

5. Scoop the cooled spaghetti squash from its skin, and place into a large bowl. Use a knife to cut up the large bunches of squash.

6. Thinly slice the fennel bulb into 1 inch segments and add to the bowl.

7. Mix in the pesto until everything is well coated.

8. Cut larger cherry tomatoes in half, and leave smaller ones intact. Add all the tomatoes to the bowl and mix well.

9. Taste the salad, and use another dash of salt if needed.
