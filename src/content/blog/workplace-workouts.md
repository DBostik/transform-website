There are a number of professions that allow for all-day exercise made essential by the nature of the work. Construction workers, fishermen and freight handlers have the benefit of getting their daily exercise from the ritual routine of their work.

For the majority of people in the workforce, burning calories throughout the day does not come easy. However, there are ways for those people stuck at a desk or behind a counter all day to get a good workout.

Take a walk during lunch

For many the daily lunch break is a way to unwind and escape from the stresses of work.  These 30-minute segments often result in the brisk consumption of overly gluttonous meals hastily engulfed in an attempt to get back to work promptly. Taking a quick walk a few blocks away to the local deli or through the park each day can help to improve health and get the blood flowing.

Skip the elevator, take the stairs

No one is going to suggest trudging up 38 flights of stairs to reach your desk in a complete sweaty mess. However, taking the stairs up or down a few floors to a meeting or lunch each day will get the heart moving and metabolism up during the day.

If taking a break, try going to a bathroom or coffee machine on a different floor by way of the stairs. Think of how many times each day you go for a quick cup of pick me up. Then add up the number a stairs you could climb by using another floor.

Ditch the office chair and find the balance of a better core

Sitting in an office chair no matter how comfortable can lead to a bad back and a sedentary lifestyle. An alternative to this office setting standard can be found with the use of a balance ball. By simply sitting on and balancing yourself on one of these spheres you can work your core and improve posture all at the same time while still allowing you be productive at your post.

Park that spare tire

Everyone that commutes to work in an congested metropolis knows that getting to the parking structure early is the key to that prime spot right next to the elevator. This leaves spots on the seventh floor in the back just waiting to get your heart up.  Choose the road less traveled and it will pay off over time with more energy and a trimmer waistline.

Accepting these and other changes into your daily routine will increase heart rate, burn calories and may help prevent health risks like diabetes that plague the office workforce. For other tips on how to get a little workout during the day consult one of our  personal trainers at Transform..
