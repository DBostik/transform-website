I’m always on the lookout for new recipes that healthy and easy to make,  but I also find variety to be important. Usually I explore all types of cuisine to find what I’m looking for: American, Indian, Asian, Mexican, etc.

Because I was raised in an Italian household, I often find myself gravitating towards Italian food, but I’ve been very conscious about expanding my horizons because I want my daughter to enjoy a wide variety of cuisines; however, this Italian girl just couldn’t resist this recipe for Italian Breakfast Panzanella.

It is easy to make and packed with flavor. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do!

Servings: 4-6  / Time: 30 mins

## DIRECTIONS

1. In the bottom of a large bowl, combine the olive oil, lemon juice or vinegar, garlic, mustard, ½ teaspoon of salt, and a few grinds of pepper.

2. Add the onion, and corn and toss until coated.

3. Let sit for 10 minutes while you prep everything else.

4. To the bowl, add the tomatoes, peaches, bread, and half the basil. Toss to combine, adding more olive oil if the bread is too dry, and more lemon, salt, and pepper, to taste.

5. Let the salad sit for about 10 minutes so that the juices can soak into the bread. Give it a toss, then top with the remaining fresh basil and the chickpeas, if using.

6. Transfer about 1 cup to each plate and let it come to room temp while you make the eggs and pour your coffee.

7. Fry the eggs and top them onto the plates with the panzanella.

8. Add freshly sliced basil and pinches of salt and pepper.

9. Enjoy your Italian Breakfast Panzanella!
