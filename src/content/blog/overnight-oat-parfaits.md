# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Make the jam. In a small saucepan over medium heat, simmer the strawberries, rhubarb, lemon juice, and salt for 10 minutes, stirring often so that the fruit doesn’t burn to the bottom of the pot. Remove from the heat and stir in the maple syrup and chia seeds. Let cool to room temperature, 20 to 30 minutes (the rhubarb will continue to soften). Transfer to a jar and chill for at least an hour.

2. Make the oats. Divide the oats into 2 glass jars, pour in the almond milk, a pinch of salt, and maple syrup, if desired. Stir, cover, and chill overnight.

3. In the morning, assemble oat jars with a generous scoop of the chia jam.

4. If desired, serve with granola, (the crunch is a nice contrast to the soft oats), maple syrup for extra sweetness, and coconut cream if you’re feeling like a decadent breakfast.
