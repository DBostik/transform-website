When it comes to truly changing the composition of your body and trading fat for muscle- watching your calories are NOT enough. ⠀⁠⠀⁠⠀


#

#


#

# Why?⁠⠀

Because if ALL of your calories come from carbohydrates and fats, you will NOT be giving your lean muscle tissue the “building blocks” it needs! ⁠

Preserving/building lean muscle tissue is NECESSARY in order to have a “lean/toned” physique” and if your lean muscle mass does not have the proper nutrients – you are more likely to end up with a “skinny/flabby” physique vs. one that is lean and toned.⁠⠀

Most people are WAYYYYYY under-eating the ONE macronutrient that is quite literally the SILVER BULLET when it comes to losing FAT and preserving lean muscle tissue..⁠⠀

⁠And what IS that one macronutrient?⁠⠀


#

# PROTEIN!!!⠀⁠⠀

There are three reasons why protein is the MOST important macronutrient when it comes to FAT LOSS..⁠⠀

1. Protein has the highest TEF or thermic effect of food. This basically means that out of all the macronutrients (carbs, fats, alcohol, protein) – that protein requires the MOST amount of calories for your body to actually BURN. In fact you burn anywhere from 15-30% of the protein calories that you eat.⁠⠀

2. Protein is muscle sparing and when paired with resistance training and a calorie deficit – it helps ensure that the body is shedding almost exclusively fat. Our muscles NEED nutrients called amino acids which are derived from protein. Without these essential nutrients – our body is more likely to BREAK DOWN muscle tissue – leaving us potentially flabbier.⁠⠀

3. Protein is extremely satiating – which when you are working towards your fat loss goal is SO important because ain’t nobody like to feel hangry!⠀⁠⠀


#

# How Much Protein?⠀⁠⠀

💖 There are many opinions on how much protein is necessary when in a calorie deficit/working towards body recomposition. I typically like to keep protein on the higher side for myself and clients so I aim for 0.8g-1g per lb of bodyweight!
