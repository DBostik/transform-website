You’ve been trying and trying, but you just can’t seem to shed those pesky pounds. Perhaps you can’t stay motivated? Maybe you can’t stick to a diet?

While weight loss is not always easy, it is achievable. However, if you’re going to lose weight, you’re going to have to start putting in some effort and following a few rules.

Are you ready to start losing weight? Experience ultimate weight loss with these simple tips.


#

# Drink the Right Beverages

You may not realize this, but you can speed up your metabolism by simply drinking the right beverages. Coffee and green tea, in particular, are fantastic for speeding up the metabolism.

It’s important, however, that you don’t overload these drinks with sugary additives. Doing so will only result in you unnecessarily consuming more calories.


#

# Prioritize Hydration

Staying adequately hydrated is absolutely vital to your overall health. However, it’s also very helpful in the weight loss process.

By substituting water for pop, milk, or other calorie-filled drinks, you will be consuming fewer calories. It’s also important to note that drinking water on a regular basis will speed up your metabolism, allowing you to burn more calories.

# Make Use of Resistance Training

The fact of the matter is that lifting weights helps to speed up your metabolism, burning more calories. This is why, if you’re trying to lose weight, you need to make use of resistance training.

Lifting 2 to 5 times a week and hitting every muscle group will also help resist the deterioration of muscles which typically comes with weight loss. If you want to look nice and toned after you’ve lost weight, resistance training will be a necessity.


#

# Get Sufficient Sleep

Another key to ultimate weight loss is to get sufficient sleep on a consistent basis. The simple truth is that the body burns more calories while asleep than it does while awake. If you’re missing sleep, you’re essentially cheating your metabolism.

At the very least, you should be getting 7 hours of sleep every night. Ideally, you’ll get 9 hours of deep sleep nightly.


#

# Consume Plenty of Protein

If you’re going to lose weight, you’re going to want to make sure that you’re consuming plenty of protein. Protein is key to losing weight for a number of reasons.

Not only does it burn more calories than the other macronutrients, it’s more filling as well. In essence, if you eat plenty of protein, you’ll burn more calories, and consume fewer calories. Good protein sources are chicken, fish, and dairy, to name just a few.


#

# Try Not to Imbibe Your Calories

The quickest way to consume calories is by drinking them. Imbibing calorie-stuffed drinks such as pop, milk, and beer will shoot you over your caloric intake maximum without you even realizing it.

For this reason, you should do everything in your power to not imbibe your calories. Replace any of your high-calorie drinks with low or no-calorie drinks.


#

# Exercise with a Friend

For some, the most troubling part of losing weight is just getting up and getting to the gym. If you struggle with this, you would be well-served by exercising with a friend.

When you have a workout partner, you’re typically more motivated to get to the gym because you don’t want to let him or her down. The two of you can essentially lean on each other for support.


#

# Make Sure Not to Starve Yourself

Often times, when people are trying to lose weight, they will eat as few calories as possible. While you should be staying below your maximum caloric intake, you should not be eating so few calories that you starve yourself.

When you starve yourself, you often find yourself in states of extreme hunger. During these extreme hungers, there’s a possibility that you will eat as much as possible so as to finally feel full.

In essence, by starving yourself for most of the day, you actually end up with a higher caloric total.


#

# Resist the Urge to Buy Junk Food

Another tip for ultimate weight loss is to resist the urge to buy junk food. When you buy junk food and have it on hand at your house, you make it very easy to eat whenever you’re feeling hungry.

This results in you eating excessive amounts of calories throughout the day.

Instead, you should stock your home with nutritious snacks such as fruit, nuts, and otherwise.


#

# Hire a Personal Trainer

Sometimes, it takes a little external motivation in order to lose weight. It’s not always easy to stay on task when you’re going it alone. If you’re having trouble staying motivated, you might consider hiring a personal trainer.

A personal trainer will ensure that you show up, carry out the correct exercises, and eat the right foods. He or she will act as a teacher and guide on your road to ultimate weight loss.
