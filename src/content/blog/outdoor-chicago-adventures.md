Its summer time, so going out for a run in the Windy City is back on the menu for the workout happy citizens of Chicago. The Second City has some of the most scenic and enjoyable outdoor landscapes of any major metropolitan city in the U.S.

The Chicagoland area is a hotspot for runners looking for a great place to take a jog or go for a healthy walk. The best personal trainers in Chicago would be able to give a rundown of the best outdoor locations for a great workout.

Lets take a look at a few of the best the city has to offer.

Mandrake Park on Pershing Rd. has a wide four-lane, half-mile track that is made of a composite rubber material. This allows for less strain on the knees of any runner than a traditional concrete surface. Located in the Oakland Community, Mandrake Park also offers basketball courts, tennis courts and baseball diamonds.

The park is often bustling with residents of Chicago until well after dark and there are lights that come on late in the day, lending to a workout long after the sun goes down. The park is open seven days a week from 6am to 11pm.

Another of Chicago’s top parks for an outdoor summer workout is Northerly Island located right on Lake Michigan in the middle of the city’s gorgeous museum district. This little-known hotspot has started to gain appreciation for its low-key vibe unlike some of Chicago’s more treacherous bike paths.

As long as you go for a workout on a night that is not set up for an outdoor concert, this is a perfect spot for running, cycling and rollerblading.

The grassy areas lend to bringing a mat or resistance bands to get a full workout right in the park. The park is available from 9am-5pm on weekdays and closes at 4pm on the weekends.

Looking to get out of the city for a run, Waterfall Glen in Darien will replace the Chicago skyscrapers with beautiful foliage and creeks. In addition to the preserve’s nearly 10-mile loop, there are additional physical activities such as cycling, rowing, golf and hiking through the woods. This scenic alternative is open daily from before sunrise until after sunset.

The best personal trainers in Chicago will always help you get the best out of your routine in the gym, but its hard not to take advantage of these and other great outdoor spots while the weather is nice.
