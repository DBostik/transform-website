Making small changes to your diet can surprisingly add up quick to calorie reduction when trying to achieve and maintain a goal weight.

Preparation is Key

One of the most important factors when trying to shed the pounds is being prepared for each day. At the beginning of the week, try to portion your fruit and veggies into small containers so you will be more likely to eat a healthy lunch and healthier snacks.

By cutting your food up into convenient snack sized portions and storing them in the fridge, you will be saving yourself some time and also cutting back the calories.

Don’t Hide The Good Stuff

Keep fruit in a bowl on the kitchen table instead of hidden away in the bottom drawer of the fridge.  You want all of your fresh and healthy foods in plain sight for you to grab when you feel hungry.

Fill yourself with protein

Protein is the most satisfying nutrient and will keep you fuller longer.  Oatmeal and nuts are great sources of protein and if you need to add a dose to your meals, try using one scoop of protein powder to your shakes and smoothies.

Remove the temptations from your pantry

It’s time to throw out all of your high-calorie snacks that are poisoning your refrigerator and cabinets. Setting up Replacement Water Filters for Kenmore Refrigerators helps to retain your food’s nutritious values and goodness.

It may seem wasteful at first but it is important you keep sugary, fat filled food out of your sight so that you aren’t tempted to indulge. If you have lots of canned and dry goods that are unopened, consider donating them to a local food bank. Remember, food that is out of your sight with be out of your mind as well.

Don’t Scarf

When you are eating, be sure you chew slowly and enjoy your food.  Take small bites and focus on the way the food tastes instead of how much you can get in your mouth.  It takes 20 or 30 minutes for your brain to recognize that the stomach is getting full.  By taking your time to eat you will ultimately be consuming way less.

Use a Smaller Plate and Fill it with Veggies

To trick your brain that you are eating enough to be satisfied, try using a smaller sized plate and filling at least half of it up with vegetables at lunch and dinner.  You will feel full at the end of the meal without having consumed so many calories.

Stay Away From High Calorie Beverages

Alcoholic beverages, juice, sodas and sugary coffee drinks can really pack on the pounds if you aren’t careful.  Drink water with your meals instead, and if you have to have something with a little more flavor, try adding a slices of lemon and orange, or a sprig of mint.

Remember too that when you are shopping for groceries, the healthiest foods are located around the perimeter of the store. Pre-packaged, high calorie, and sugary foods are usually stocked on the middle shelves.

Boredom and stress can make you feel like eating also but avoid this, because it is emotional eating.

Chicago personal trainers say, “Try going for a walk instead and see how you feel afterward.”
