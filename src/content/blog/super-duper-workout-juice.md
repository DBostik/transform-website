Before busting your moves out with the best personal trainer in Chicago, it’s a good idea to feed your body with nutrients to provide your mind and muscles the energy it needs for the workout ahead.  Never mind the intensity of the iron pumping or the treadmill running, juice will cure hunger pangs and keep you full for the duration of your session.

Juicing is easy!To get started, buy a juicer. They’re a great investment, trust me. Then, all you need to do is shop around for the best quality fruit, vegetables, a few spices, and a good quality bottle of H2O. This is where it gets fun! You get to experiment with varieties of fruits and vegetables, and fresh juice is so much better for you.

It’s not over processed and it’s full of vitamins, minerals, and whole nutrients.

Juice that sits for longer than 24 hours tends to separate, leaving it not so appetizing for the beginner.For a sweeter version of juice you could add an apple, grapes, or a cucumber. If you like it spicy celery salt, a few cloves of garlic, or a dash of hot sauce should suffice. Just go with your gut, literally, when combining ingredients.

Whatever fruit and vegetables smell good together, will taste good together. If you are unsure about nutrition information, find a personal trainer today.Happy juicing!
