What would you do if you knew you couldn’t fail? How would it feel to love yourself unconditionally and break the chains of fear, regret, and self-sabotage?

What story would be playing in your head NOW if you stopped eating unhealthy food, sitting around being inactive, and put everyone else first and started doing fueling your body with nutritious foods, working out, and placing your own health and happiness first instead?

Think, what would breaking addiction do for you and your family How would it feel to have absolute clarity on goals, and how to get there? What if it meant put yourself first consistently?

# My Struggle

For the past 15 months, I’ve been on a journey to defeat my tendency to put everyone else’s happiness before mine and actually take care of myself. I had the tendency of always putting my own needs and wants last. The few times I would put my own desires before others’, I felt guilty putting myself first. I know I’m not the only one whose felt this way.

Since December 2019, I’ve made a conscious effort everyday to put me first. Might sound selfish, but hear me out. I’ve been consistently working out, eating right, and carving out time everyday for myself to do something enjoyable.

This isn’t always an easy feat, especially when I have my toddler at my heels every waking moment as I try to tackle basic household tasks and/or work responsibilities … all while loving the person staring back at me in the mirror.

I have my good days and bad days just like anyone else. Believe me; I’ve failed more times than you could ever begin to imagine; Yet, I’ve come out the other side, and I can honestly say I did it.

It was TOUGH; however, I am in an amazing place right now: much lower stress levels, improved friendships, happier in my marriage, and overall improved health (mental, emotional, psychological, physical, etc). Things aren’t perfect, but they are much better than they were and I’m the happiest I’ve been in a LONG time.

And it’s all because I consistently put myself first.

# Your Turn

It’s your turn now, your moment. I’m going to use an analogy I’ve used before just because it’s that good and seems to stick with people. Your life (especially your health) is like an oxygen mask in an airplane safety demonstration. They always say to put on your mask first before helping others.

If you aren’t at your best, how are you to be at your best for those around you? When you put yourself first is not selfish, it’s necessary.

Lucky for you, you’ve got me in your corner. I’m at the top of that mountain you’ve been trying to climb for years. My hand is out, and I’m cheering you on, ready and willing to pull you up with me and the thousands of other men and women I’ve helped.

I don’t know who you are or what sticking points you’re facing in your life. But I do know that you CAN do this. And if you take this journey with me you WILL be successful and have one of the most transformative seasons of your life. You won’t recognize yourself when I’m through with you. Time to get in the habit of putting yourself first. You don’t just deserve that, you NEED that.
