“Stop leaving and you will arrive. Stop searching and you will see. Stop running away and you will be found.”—Lao Tzu

# COMMIT TO IT

It’s sad knowing that some of you won’t ever commit to yourself and your health fully. You won’t do the work. How do I know this? Because I did the same and I rationalized in my mind why it was okay not to do the work. What was really happening? I was scared; scared of what might be revealed about my life, the people in my life, me.

Eventually, I couldn’t lie to myself anymore and I ran out of reasons to run. The same books, courses, coaches I avoided, I eventually dove into 120%. They ended up being the resources that changed my life. Finally, I committed to it and overcame my mind as well as my excuses. I did and do the work.

# EXCUSES RUN OUT

Like myself, you too will eventually run out of reasons to run. There’s no doubt in my mind that as you continue to follow me, you will say to yourself, “I’ll put this off until later.” That’s natural. Your brain wasn’t designed to do what’s comfortable. But, I’m telling you don’t do that. Do the work.

If you want to be in great shape, fall in love with the person of your dreams (or even yourself again), grow in meaningful way, and cross off the big, ambitious goals on your bucket list then overcoming your past and current sticking points is non-negotiable.

Instead of waiting until the end of the month to create your New Years resolution, figure it out now. Think about what you want in life and create a plan. Set goals with benchmarks. Stock up on what you need in order to be successful on your endeavor. Commit to accomplishing this, then do the work! If you’re not sure how or what to do, reach out.

We can help you set realistic goals as well as attain them. No one said you have to do this alone.

And for those of you who are further down the path of moving away from self-sabotage and ending behaviors that hurt you, here’s a news flash… We all have work to do we all benefit from this type of work. You deserve happiness and to live a life free from your past and the shackles that keep you stuck. Also, you deserve an overabundance of love, health, and wealth! It’s your birthright!
