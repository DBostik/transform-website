In previous blogs, I’ve touched upon what to eat to meet your health and fitness goals. But did you know nutrient timing is just as important? Nutrient timing strategies are based on how the body handles different types of food at different times.

One of the most important nutrient timing principles is that it’s best to eat most non-fruit and veggie carbohydrates during and after exercise (typically earlier in the day).

# TIMING BASED ON YOUR GOAL

Different people have different goals. One size does not fit all. With that being said, read below to figure out when is best for you to eat so you can reach your fitness goals.

- If you are lean and simply want to maintain your existing body composition, consuming more carbohydrates throughout the day will likely be fine.

- If you want to lose body fat, first control overall food intake, then aim to consume a majority of carb dense foods during and after exercise sessions (for about 3 hours after). Outside of the 3 hour window consume primarily protein and fat, while consuming fewer carb dense foods (25% of less of meal made up of carb dense foods). Typically have your carbs at breakfast and lunch. Read my most recent blog for examples and a little more specifics.

- If you want to gain muscle, the nutrient timing principles are similar — simply add more calories overall.

In all cases, assess your progress and adjust as necessary. You might start by eating to stay lean and maintaining, but if you want to gain muscle or cut body fat, then you’ll need to make some adjustments.
