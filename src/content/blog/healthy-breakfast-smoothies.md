Not sure about you, but I’m the type of person who NEEDS something to eat first thing in the morning. Ever heard of hangry (a.k.a when someone gets angry because they’re super hungry)? Yep, it’s a real thing. Just ask my relatives. It isn’t pretty. With that said, I don’t like spending tons of time prepping things for their sake or mine.

I likes recipes that are easy to make first thing in the morning to get my metabolism going. Healthy breakfast smoothies are perfect for this!

The following healthy breakfast smoothies do the trick. They don’t take much time to make and are healthy. Thank to Jeaninne Donofrio @LoveandLemons for providing these. Prep fruits and veggies ahead of time to make blending these healthy breakfast smoothies a breeze on busy mornings.

Below are the ingredients and instructions for how to make five different smoothies. Give them a try and let us know which one is your favorite!

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Assemble ½ banana into each freezer container (or freezer safe baggie). Add fruits/vegetables, then place your containers into the freezer until you’re ready to blend each one.

2. Blend each smoothie with a few pieces of ice and ½ cup to ¾ cup almond milk (enough almond milk to get your blender blade moving).

3. Blend in “extras” (goji berries, almond butter, maca, matcha, cacao) at the end.

NOTES: I use a Vitamix. If your blender isn’t as powerful, let your frozen smoothie ingredients thaw at room temperature for just a few minutes.
