As you’ve heard me tell you in posts prior to this, fueling your body with healthy, nutritious food is crucial and so is keeping what you eat varied. With that being said, today I have for you five different frittatas. They’re all super easy to make and taste great!

Not only are frittatas a great way to get in your protein (because of the eggs), but also it’s a great way to get your morning serving of veggies in. Since these recipes already have enough protein and veggies, round off the meal with a healthy carb. For example, make some roasted potatoes or a piece of wheat toast (but make sure to avoid lathering that with butter or jelly).

Prep Time: 5 mins / Cook Time: 25 mins
