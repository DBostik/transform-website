There are countless benefits to working out with a personal trainer or going for a jog several times each week. Better health, a trimmer waistline and longer life expectancy are all a direct result of regular physical activity. But can routinely exercising result in a more youthful appearance? Scientific research and common sense says yes.

What happens when we work out on a regular basis? Most would say it leads to increased energy, improved self-esteem and more restful sleep. All of which can bring about younger looks.

Regular exercise also improves the human immune system. Science tells us that people that work out each day in some fashion will have increased white blood cells. This means fewer viruses and bacteria in the system. Not having that worn out look everyday will do wonders for anyone’s appearance.

Ever wake up with those dark circles that make you want to put a fist-sized hole in a mirror each morning. This is caused by insomnia, which in turn is often the result of stress. The dark circles are from the increase of cortisol in the bloodstream. This build up will end with those dark circles swirling around your eyes each day.

This cortisol stockpile can be alleviated with exercise. More restful sleep means a fresher feeling and cleaner look each morning.

A sedentary lifestyle free of exercise can also cause poor posture. Sitting at your desk each day punching buttons causes workers to hunch over and leads to damage in the back muscles and spine. Ever see that older looking man or woman that seems to be unable to lift their head without pain? It’s not a youthful look.

Regular exercise not only helps to eliminate this look in those too young to be saddled with it. Staying active can even make you taller. Yes taller! Activities such as yoga can help stretch out the muscles and decompress the spine, leading to a longer and leaner look.

Getting fit can also lead to enhanced sex hormones. Yes, getting into shape will make you more appealing to the opposite sex, but it also makes you feel sexier. The rush of testosterone in males allows for a more active sex life. What makes a person feel younger than a great sex life?

Getting fit and exercising has multiple benefits for everyone. Staying in shape and living longer are the goals everyone works towards, but looking a few years younger never hurt anyone.
