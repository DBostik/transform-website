Pizza, potato chips, pretzels, cookies, ice cream, candy… the list of foods people crave goes on and on.We hear about pregnant women having crazy cravings at all hours of the night. Personally, I craved ice cream as well as peanut butter and jelly sandwiches throughout my pregnancy (Halo Top’s PB&J ice cream was HEAVENLY).

Even after giving birth to my daughter, I still find myself dealing with cravings from time to time. I know I’m not the only one. Cravings happen and not just to pregnant women. Whether it is something sweet or something savory, everyone gets cravings at one point or another.

I could ask you what you crave, but I know you’re here seeking advice about your cravings. The real question is how to avoid food cravings?
