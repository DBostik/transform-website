# Top Diet Myths That Are Stopping You from Losing Weight

Here are the most common diet myths that could be stopping you from losing weight.


#

#


# Working Out Means You Can Eat Whatever

Abs are made as much in the kitchen as they are in the gym. You can’t lose weight just by working out and then stuffing yourself with pizza.

While the theory of calories in versus calories out suggests this myth is true, in reality, the quality of your calories is just as important in helping you achieve your weight loss goals.


#

#


# A Calorie Is a Calorie

Not all calories are equal, which is why calorie-counting your way to a size six isn’t always the best approach.

Calories don’t take into account the nutritional benefit of a food. Something that’s high in calories could be good or bad for you. Avocado, for example, is high in calories because of its natural fat content, but there are plenty of vitamins included too. A candy bar with the same calorie count, however, won’t provide you with balanced nutrition.


#

#


# Protein Shakes Help You Lose Weight

Protein shakes are designed for athletes and those who have heavy workouts to help replenish essential nutrients the body uses up during exercise.

If you do have a protein shake after your intense exercise workouts, make sure you’re accounting for these calories in your daily intake. It’s easy to underestimate your liquid calories and protein shakes provide a calorie hit that you might not need.


#

#


# Eggs Are Bad for You

This myth started decades ago when the cereal companies wanted to sell more breakfast cereal. They conducted a self-funded study to show that cereal was better for breakfast than eggs, which had been the standard morning fare.

An egg, however, is a wonder food. Filled with protein and vital nutrients, eggs will provide a filling snack or add essential amino acids to any meal. They are low in calories and pack a high-nutrient punch.


#

#


# Don’t Eat After 8 pm

Food can’t tell time. Your body will always digest and use the energy you eat at any time – if you eat late, it’ll store the excess until you need it in the morning.

Eating just before bedtime has downsides, though. It’ll leave you with a full stomach that will disturb your sleep as it digests, leaving you tired and tempted for a sugary snack when you wake up.


#

#


# Pasta Should Be Avoided

When you’re following a diet and exercise regimen your body needs reliable carbohydrates for essential processes at a cellular level.

Pasta has been given a bad rep in recent times, not least since gluten intolerance became fashionable. However, eating moderate amounts of pasta the day before a big workout can make a big difference and help you achieve your personal best.

Portion size is the key with pasta: try having it as a side rather than a main meal, to avoid overloading on calories. Ditch the creamy sauces, too, and opt for a tomato-based sauce instead.


#

#


# Fasting is Best for Quick Weight Loss

Fasting for days on end will make you lose water weight, and because you’re not eating food you’ll also notice that you’re less bloated.

It is not, however, a long-term solution to lose weight. You only lose water weight (and after time, muscle mass) if you’re fasting – not fat.

Intermittent fasting has shown some benefits in aiding weight loss in some individuals, but this is often because of the natural calorie restriction. It’s harder to eat a full day’s calories in one small time period, so people on an intermittent fasting regimen are likely to be eating less overall.


#

#


# Fasted Workouts Make You Lose Weight Quickly

The idea behind a fasted workout is that your body will use the energy stores it already has. In theory, that means you’re using up fat already in your body rather than using energy from recently-eaten food.

However, eating after a fasted workout will restore your body’s energy levels to its previous state. Fasting will also reduce your stamina, so you won’t be able to exercise for as long or as hard.


#

#


# You Can Eat As Much As You Like If It’s Healthy

Healthy foods still have calories so eating lots and lots will scupper your weight loss goals. You need to monitor how many calories you eat and drink during the day if you want to lose weight.

Healthier calories from vegetables are great – but they still count towards your daily intake.


#

#


# Exercise Makes You Gain Weight

You will only bulk up with exercise if that’s your goal. You will, however, notice the scale goes up and down when you’ve made big changes to your workout schedule.

Exercise causes micro-tears in the muscles. This makes your body deploy its response to inflammation: swelling. After a very heavy workout, you could gain a few pounds of water weight. This will go away after a few weeks, though!

# Three Surprising Diet Myths That Are Actually True

With those diet myths busted, what about the surprising tips you’ve heard about but don’t think are true?


#

#


# Zero Calorie Foods Exist

Yes, there are foods that contain fewer calories than it takes to digest them, making them zero- or negative-calorie foods. These include celery, cucumber, and grapefruit.

However, these foods are often limited in nutrients too, so go easy on them and remember that a ‘rainbow diet’ with lots of different colors on your plate is the way to go.


#

#


# Sleep Helps You Lose Weight

It’s not just because you can’t eat while you sleep, either. Sleep regulates certain hormones in the body, such as ghrelin, which activates the ‘hunger’ feeling in the stomach.

Good sleep hygiene, including getting plenty of rest on a regular daily routine, is very important for anyone on a diet. It helps to restore your energy and lets your body recover and repair itself from your workouts.


#

#


# Drink Water to Lose Weight

Water isn’t going to be the only thing that helps you to lose weight, but staying hydrated will move you towards your goals. Thirst is often mistaken for hunger, so instead of reaching for a snack when you feel a rumble in your stomach, have a drink of water first instead.

Drinking water also means you’re not taking in excess calories in the form of other drinks, such as cream-laden coffee or sugary iced tea.
