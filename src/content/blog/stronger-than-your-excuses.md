Especially around the holidays, you’ll see pictures on social media of people look in a state of utopic happiness donned in matching outfits with their pets, kids, and/or significant others. If you’re one of those, won’t lie, I’m a little envious. I don’t have it together enough or maybe I just don’t have the energy anymore to make that amount of effort.

To be honest, I know I’m not alone. it’s very rare that people have it all together. As I admitted above, I do NOT have it altogether.

Instead of the “pretty version,” where everything looks perfectly in place, I’m going to share the REAL version with you of what it’s like to work full time, be a parent, and live a healthy lifestyle during a pandemic. It starts with being stronger than your excuses.

# Before Baby & Afterwards

I love my 20 month old little girl and can’t imagine life without her. If you have kids, you already know and understand the challenges a toddler brings. For those who don’t have kids, let me tell you… toddlers are CONSTANTLY on the go and getting into absolutely EVERYTHING imaginable.

They are moody, demanding, and get frustrated often times due to their inability to communicate their needs and wants verbally.

Life before baby was pretty good overall. I had a routine and it worked well for me. I felt fairly well-balanced and in a good place. However, when baby girl arrived, finding the balance between work and home life became challenging. It was a struggle before the pandemic and even more so since. I’ll be honest, it is HARD and it is not picture perfect.

# Which Excuse to Use?

I could go on and make excuse after excuse as to why I don’t have time to do the things I want to:

- I don’t have childcare available.

- I have too much work to do.

- I’m too tired and just want to rest.

- It’s too cold to go for a run.

- I have to clean the house.

- I need to meal prep instead.

The list goes on and on as to why I could put off my goals and the things I need to do to reach them. However, I choose to not to cave in to those excuses and you should do likewise. Be stronger than your excuses if you really want to reach your goals. It’s not easy, it’s definitely time consuming and a challenge.

Guess what… the best things in life usually happen that way. Life is all about finding the balance in your juggling act even if it’s not exactly perfect.

# A Juggling Act

Both my hubby and I work from home majority of the time. That means we have to juggle working full time and parent duty. This morning was pretty standard for us and probably is for so many others right now who are working from home and have kids.

The hubby had a call so I was on mom-duty. I wanted to get a workout in, but needed time not just to get my sweat on as well as to shower before my 10:00am Zoom meeting. That meant bringing little lady into the garage with me while I worked out.

On days where I have to do this, mini-me gets into things, makes a huge mess, erases the whiteboard with my workout on it, takes off her shoes repeatedly, and gets in the way.

# Just Do It

Although not ideal, I still do it. I work out and in the process model for my daughter the importance of prioritizing health and fitness. You’d be surprised how often she imitates some of the movements, like planks, ropes & squat presses. As a former teacher, I know from experience that modeling and repetition are key in learning.

I want my daughter to learn and understand that eating right and working out at necessary things to do in order to live a healthy lifestyle and be able to do everything she wants to do in life no matter what.

I could make excuses not to workout due to my crazy work schedule and the lack of childcare available, but I choose not to. I choose to MAKE THE TIME and MAKE IT HAPPEN because my health is a priority to me. Is yours? Are you stronger than your excuses? Are you dedicated to doing whatever it takes to reach your goals, even if the circumstances aren’t ideal?

If haven’t been putting your health and wellness at the forefront, then it’s time to do so now. Be stronger than your excuses! Make your health a priority.

# Not At That Point Yet?

If you’re struggling with doing it by yourself, then get some help. Reach out. There is no shame in doing so. If you don’t step up and say something, then you’ll continue to silently struggle which will ultimately impact your social, emotional, psychological, and mental health. Know that I am here for you and that I am happy to help (as are the rest of the rockstars on the Transform team).

I’d love the opportunity to help you reach your goals. Here is a small snapshot of some of the parents and individuals without kids who we’ve helped since Transform opened in 2010: https://transformpersonaltraining.com/meet-the-team/
