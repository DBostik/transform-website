Taking your fitness journey seriously goes beyond the work you put in with a trainer or at the gym.

It requires dedication and discipline in many areas of your life, like healthy dieting and a regular sleep schedule.

Unfortunately, some people have the misconception healthy eating is more expensive or more difficult than a regular diet. Little do they know, the right planning and habits can easily change the way a person eats and lead to a better fitness lifestyle.

In fact, it can all begin at your city’s local Sunday farmers market.

Chicago has over 60 markets around the city, and we have all the tricks you need to know to best navigate whichever one you choose.

# 1. Have a Plan

Like any big goal you have in mind, you have to make a plan.

A Sunday farmers market can be the perfect playground for your inner fit foodie just as much as it can steer you away from your goals. Arrive with a plan in mind about what you want to cook for the week.

Think about what produce is in season, what lasts well in the fridge, and the kind of food you want to eat.

Maybe if you had Italian-inspired meals the week before, you want to take a Spanish or Indian twist on this week’s menu. Either way, being aware of such influences can help get you in and out of the Sunday farmers market.

Planning the kind of meals you want to prep can help when temptation comes your way. There are many sweets and delicious delights at a farmers market, but sticking to your list will help significantly.


#

# 2. Walk the Market First

Although your list is important, don’t just start shopping at the first vendor you see.

Always do a lap around the market to check out what is going on during that particular Sunday. Some days, you may see a vendor offering a special for a type of produce about to go out of season. Other days, you might be able to find deals for bundles or mixing and matching produce.

Walking the market also gives you a chance to take everything in.

It’s kind of like the rule of not going to the grocery store when you’re hungry – it allows you to focus on what you’re really there for.

Scope out the best places (and prices) to buy what is on your list for the upcoming week. Then, start shopping and do your best not to nibble on a free sample from the local baker.


#

# 3. Ask Questions and Get to Know Your Vendors

As you shop, make note of getting to know your local vendors.

It’s better to look at the Sunday farmers market like an experience, not an errand to rush through. The more personable you are with the farmers, the more you will get to know how the market really works.

Don’t be surprised if you sometimes see an extra bit of produce in your bag from a farmer who knows you by name.

Also, remember most vendors have a genuine love for food. They can give you more cooking and preparation ideas to keep your healthy eating journey interesting and exciting.

This will be of great benefit later on, because sometimes sticking to healthy eats means switching up your routine.

Vendors can give you new recipes to try or even just produce you may have never noticed before. You’ll be surprised how just one simple change can completely transform a meal or a routine in general.

# 4. Buy in Bulk

While it is important to try new types of produce and healthy food recipes, there are some things you can buy in bulk.

Buying in bulk has multiple benefits. It can save you money over time, give you a go-to meal or snack to stay on track, and, usually, it will last a while at home.

The best bulk items to buy are grains or nuts. These have a long shelf life, and they are very popular in healthy eating recipes.

But, did you know there are payoffs to buying large amounts of produce, too?

Some people are averse to this idea because they are afraid it will go bad. However, once you get into the groove of planning your meals, you will be more aware of what you need, meaning spoiling won’t be an issue.

Instead, buying produce in bulk can help you save money on the things you know you regularly use.

For instance, if you’re a fan of fruit in your protein shakes, you can buy a whole case or flat of your favorite fruits and freeze it. This ensures your shakes are delicious every time, and your wallet will be happy as well.

Buying in bulk also means you will always have something in your freezer for last-minute meals.

It is very common for people to turn to dining out or fast food when they are on a tight schedule. Instead, stay ahead of the game and use bulk buys to prep easily frozen, healthy meals like vegetable soups or simple stir-fry.

# 5. Make the Sunday Farmers Market Part of Your Routine

The best way to reach your fitness goals in the kitchen is with small changes in your daily life. Add going to the Sunday farmers market to your weekly routine and watch how much better the rest of the week goes.

The Sunday market is a great excuse to support the local community and do something for yourself as well. Plus, after a morning exploring the stalls and talking with vendors, you will be excited to get home and start meal prepping.

It all works together while you are hard at work to achieve the looks and strength you want.

Remember, much of your fitness journey starts in the kitchen, and your kitchen habits can get a serious upgrade from the Sunday farmers market.
