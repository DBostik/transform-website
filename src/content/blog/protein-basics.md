Not going to pull out my science teacher hat and start diving into protein too deep, but rather, I want to cover some protein basics so you can understand why so much emphasis is put on protein consumption. Let’s start with two of the most common myths about protein, however, before doing so, please know that there is no judgement if you thought either of these to be true.

# MYTHS BUSTED

First, let’s bust the notion that protein means meat. You can get protein from meat, but you need you have to be careful with what types. Not all meats are created equally; some are fattier than others. Below I’ve listed a couple examples of approved protein packed meats. Also, notice there are some non-meat sources of protein.

Honestly, I’m not a vegetarian, but I am not a huge meat person. With that being said, I tend to pack in protein mostly by eating eggs and protein powder. Maybe you’re like me or maybe you’re not, but whatever your preference may be, just make sure you get protein into your meals.

Another notable myth needing to be busted… protein will make me big. Sorry or thankfully (depending on how you look at it), it is not going to give you muscles that make you look like the Incredible Hulk. There’s a lot more that goes into having that type of physique.

Because of this myth, often times people (typically females) veer away from packing in protein. Don’t let this myth get to you. Protein actually helps with the weight loss process and aids in getting your body toned.

# PROTEIN BASICS

Protein is an essential macronutrient that is key in building muscle mass and they are the building blocks of life. Did you know that your hair, nails, bones, and muscles are all made up of protein? “Protein gives tissues and organs their shape and also helps them work the way they should. In short, protein is one of the building blocks that make you into who you are.” (1).

It strengthens bones, boosts your immune system, builds muscle, is an emergency source of energy, curbs cravings, burns fat, lower blood pressure, decrease LDL (bad cholesterol), heals injuries, moves nutrients throughout your body, etc. In short, protein works wonders for your body so you should be consuming it regularly.

# SOURCES OF PROTEIN

As mentioned, we’re covering some protein basics. Don’t want to throw too much at you all at once so let’s start with some easy ways you can get protein into your diet. Below is a list of the most common protein sources that I recommend. Most people eat them already so it should be pretty easy to add more protein to what you’re already doing.

Know that there are other ways to get protein in as well. These are not the only items that contain protein, which is a good thing because our vegetarian and vegan friends would be in trouble if that were the case.

- lean meats – beef, lamb, veal, pork, kangaroo, venison, bison

- beans

- poultry – chicken, turkey, duck, emu, goose, bush birds

- fish and seafood – fish, prawns, crab, lobster, mussels, oysters, scallops, clams, tuna

- eggs

- dairy products – milk, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese

- protein powder

# PROTEIN FOR VEGETARIANS & VEGANS

Protein is NOT just for meat-eaters. It’s important for everyone so if you choose to live a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle, then you’ll have to acquire your protein in other ways. Here’s a list of other sources of protein that are more friendly to those who live the vegan and vegetarian lifestyle:

- asparagus

- avocado

- broccoli

- beans

- cauliflower

- chia seeds

- hemp seeds

- goji berries

- kale

- lentils

- protein powder

- quinoa

- potato

- spinach

- spirulina

- sweet potato

- tofu

- nuts and seeds
