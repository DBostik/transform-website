Finding time to prepare a healthy meal, especially when you’re on the go in the morning, can be challenging. Instead of spending the extra cash and waiting in line at your local coffee shop, opt for something healthier like this new vegan friendly Creamy Avocado Smoothie recipe (Thanks toJeanine Donofrio over at @LoveandLemons for providing).

It tastes so yummy! We had these the other day. It was super easy to make we only needed a few things,  it took only 5 minutes to make, and the best part about it is that it packs a powerful healthy punch.

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Combine the pineapple, spinach, avocado, banana, coconut milk, lime juice, maple syrup, salt, ice, and protein powder, if using, in a blender. Blend until creamy.

2. Taste and adjust the sweetness to your liking. If you prefer a sweeter smoothie, add more maple syrup. If the consistency is too thick, add more coconut milk, and blend again.
