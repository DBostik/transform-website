- 1 tsp salt

- 1 tbsp arrowroot powder

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Combine all of the ingredients for the tahini lemon sauce in a bowl and whisk together. Set aside.

2. Grate the sweet potato and the apple into a large mixing bowl. Squeeze as much liquid out of the grated sweet potato and apple as possible and transfer the squeezed mixture into a clean bowl. Add the onion, salt, arrowroot, spelt flour, olive oil, turmeric, and pepper. Mix to combine.

3. Heat a cast iron pan (or other skillet) over medium – high heat. Add approximately 2 tbsp olive oil.

4. When the pan is hot take a handful (about 1/4 cup) of the latke batter and squeeze it together into a flat-ish round patty. Place it on the hot pan and press down on it with a spatula. Cook for 2 – 4 minutes per side until golden brown and crispy. Transfer to a plate or wire rack covered in paper towel to cool. Repeat until all of the latkes are cooked (you can place the cooked ones in the oven at 200 to keep them warm while cooking).

5. Serve hot with plenty of sauce!
