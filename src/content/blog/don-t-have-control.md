Constantly second-guessing. Indecision. Changing course. Flip-flopping. Putting things off. Wanting something but acting in ways that make it impossible to have. Scrolling through emotions. Believing and not believing at the same time. You don’t feel in control of your life and wondering why.

# Trust

Not trusting yourself is the hallmark of low self-esteem, thinking small, overindulging and why those challenged by it don’t feel in control of their lives. Trustworthiness is an abiding character state. A trustworthy person is someone who is reliable, consistent, and truthful in their actions across the board. It isn’t that they are perfect.

Rather, their actions spring from and reinforce their moral values and commitments.

When a person sees themselves as untrustworthy to themselves and to others, they are less able to successfully live their life. People who don’t trust themselves create self-perpetuating cycles of stress and anxiety to ensure they never get to that place where they’re happy or satisfied.

This ensures they never run out of whips to crack over their own back. It’s why they feel like they can’t escape their “problems,” why they weirdly plateau at the place where it’s “just barely enough,” and why they persistently dwell on worries.

# Your Rights

The mind is such a powerful instrument. It’s time you retune yours, trust yourself, and allow in the things you’ve always wanted and deserve. You have the right to:

- trust yourself

- ask for what you want

- make mistakes and not have to be perfect

- follow your own values and standards

- expect honesty from others and yourself

- feel angry, sad, and afraid

- make your own decisions

- be playful and healthy

- treat yourself with respect

- be happy


#

# Trust Yourself

None of that can happen if you don’t trust yourself enough to allow yourself to have those rights and live by those rights. Time to steer your life in the direction you want it to go. No more feeling like you don’t have control. Where do you need improvement? Sit down and really think about it. Then, develop a plan and take action. You’ve got this!
