# Weight-Loss-Friendly Foods

1. WHOLE EGGS — Although a high intake of eggs raises the levels of “bad” LDL-cholesterol in some people, they are one of the best foods to eat if you need to lose weight. They are high in protein and fat, and are very satiating.

2. LEAFY GREENS — Leafy greens include kale, spinach, collards, Swiss chards and a few others. They have several properties that make them perfect for a weight loss diet, such as being low in calories and carbohydrates and loaded with fiber.

3. SALMON – Fatty fish like salmon is incredibly healthy and very satisfying, keeping you full for many hours with relatively few calories. Salmon is loaded with high-quality protein, healthy fats and various important nutrients.

4. LEAN BEEF AND CHICKEN BREAST — Meat has been unfairly demonized. It has been blamed for various health problems despite a lack of good evidence to back up these negative claims.
