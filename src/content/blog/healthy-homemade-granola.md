As promised in previous posts, I will continue to send healthy recipes your direction. Building up a library filled with nutritious options is an important part of living a healthy lifestyle. Fueling your body with the right types of food will make you look and feel amazing. Today I’m passing along a healthy homemade granola breakfast recipe.

This is another easy recipe to make. Also, it’s a nice way to switch things up in the morning. And even better, it’s vegan!

- PREP TIME: 10 minutes

- COOK TIME: 30 minutes

# INGREDIENTS

- 2 cups whole rolled oats

- 1/2 cup chopped walnuts

- 1/2 cup coconut flakes, optional

- 2 teaspoons cinnamon

- 1/2 teaspoon sea salt

- 2 tablespoons melted coconut oil

- 1/4 cup maple syrup

- 2 tablespoons creamy almond butter

- 1/3 cup dried cranberries, optional

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat the oven to 300°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. In a medium bowl, combine the oats, walnuts, coconut flakes, if using, cinnamon, and salt. Drizzle in the coconut oil and maple syrup and add the almond butter. Stir until combined.

3. Scoop the granola onto the baking sheet and press the mixture into a 1-inch-thick oval. This will encourage clumping.

4. Bake for 15 minutes, rotate the pan halfway, and use a fork to gently break the granola apart just a bit. Bake for 15 minutes more, or until golden brown.

5. Sprinkle with dried cranberries, if desired. Let cool for 15 minutes before serving.

I have a feeling that this one will go over well. Let me know your thoughts on it. As usual, I’m always looking for feedback. Also, feel free to share this recipe with your friends.
