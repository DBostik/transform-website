Many of our clients ask the question, “Is it possible to drink and diet at the same time?” Before answering you, let’s set the record straight about dieting. Dieting is restrictive. It cuts things out from your life and is not sustainable. Often times people hop on diets, lose weight, then eventually gain all that weight back and sometimes more.

Trust me, I know from experience. I’ve done Weight Watchers, Seattle Sutton, NutriSystem, Keto, etc. Diets are not sustainable. We believe in healthy living, which entails consistently eating healthy, regularly exercising, drinking plenty of water, getting enough sleep, and managing stress. And that means you can still enjoy things, just in moderation.


# Good News, It is Possible!

Good news, drinking and maintaining your fitness goals is POSSIBLE. The idea that you can’t enjoy a drink while being on a fitness journey is completely FALSE. It’s all about MODERATION. Drinking 1-2 times a week and sticking to 1-2 drinks each occasion is fine.

When you do decide to drink just know there are options out there for you so you are not just consuming those extra calories. Here are some smart low calorie drinks for your enjoyment.

- Tequila shots and other hard liquor

- Light beer ⁠

- Wine/champagne

- Vodka or Gin and tonic⁠ ⁠

Reminder, check the nutritional label before consuming, especially with boozy water like White Claw. Some of those pack up to 170 calories per can. Remember this journey isn’t supposed to be boring, enjoy yourself, and as always drink responsibly.
