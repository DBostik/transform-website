How would you like to lose 22lbs in 7 weeks? Well one of our clients did it and she is not stopping!
Meg has only been with Transform Personal Training for 7 weeks yet she is having amazing success.  Her accomplishments are just another of the many examples of what the amazing personal trainers here at Transform can do.

One of the most amazing parts of her Transformation too is that she is a pastry chef so she is surrounded by amazing sweets ALL DAY LONG. So next time you think you have a good excuse for not eating well and not hitting your goals then just think of Meg.

Anything is possible if you just put your mind to it and put in the effort. Way to go Meg!
