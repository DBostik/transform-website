Let’s face it, the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic rocked the boat for most people in so many ways. Personally it turned my world upside down completely. We had to make the tough decision to permanently close our group fitness studios since so many people weren’t/aren’t comfortable going back to gyms yet.

Also, we moved in with my parents as we tried to salvage our business and take care of our toddler. For the record, I am eternally grateful to have wonderful, loving parents who were there to help us out. I wish everyone to be as fortunate as we were in that respect.

Between March to August we closed down and cleared out two fitness facilities, sold and moved out of our condo downtown, emptied our storage locker (a Herculean task in itself), and moved into a new home… all while we completely reinvented our fitness business to just one-on-one training and a remote coaching program.

To say the least, it was mass chaos and super stressful. I know my husband and I aren’t the only ones who’ve been to hell and back within the last year. Though, I will say that as rough as that was, it forced me to learn and understand the importance of Me Time.

# More Than Physical

Health is so much more is than just a physical thing. There are many forms of health: physical, social, emotional, mental spiritual, financial, etc. The pandemic has put a strain on most of those for so many people, myself included. It has caused a lot of burn out. How do we stop that from continuing to happen to ourselves?

Well, one way is to make your health a priority. Spend a little time on and for yourself each and everyday.

# Mass Burn Out


#

#


## The Teacher

Burn out happened before the pandemic, but seemingly has been amplified with the mandatory stay at home orders. Let’s take schools first example. I’m a former teacher who worked in private and public schools in Chicago (including CPS). Being a teacher is hard work. It’s not an 9am-3pm job with summers off (Whoever made up that lie, should be smacked).

It’s a very demanding job on so many levels. Now add a pandemic on top of things… oh boy. Imagine being a pre-school or kindergartner teacher trying to get students to participate in e-learning. The thought of that alone should cause anxiety. One of my good friends is a kindergartner teacher.

She told me she’s had to send multiple emails to parents reminding their children to be clothed for e-learning classes online.

Another colleague shared with me that her principal makes her and her fellow educators call every student who didn’t show up for class everyday. This is in addition to lesson planning, grading, responding to communication from parents/guardians & administrators, and recreating the way they teach to accommodate virtual learning.

This year for teacher appreciation day, send your kid’s/kids’ teachers wine or a gift card. They sure deserve it.

## The Parents

Not only were teachers dealt a crappy hand, but so were the parents and kids. Try being a full time parent with either working from home or having to go to work because you’re an essential worker.

Working at home parents balancing their full-time workload as well as trying to be on top of the kid(s) education almost requires that they themselves be an educator to ensure their child(ten) stay(s) on track.

On top of that, they are trying to stay on top of their own work loads while their children are in the background making it hard to concentrate and make/take calls.

And then there’s the parents who go into work. They are trying to figure out childcare financially and logistically. Some families don’t have the means to afford childcare and have had to reduce their hours at work or possibly stop working completely just to make sure someone is available to care for his/her child(ren).

Those that do still work have added stress of being concerned they could possibly contract COVID-19 and bring it home to their families. Neither situation is ideal.

## The Kids

And then there are the kids [sigh]. My heart goes out to them the most. Their academic situation isn’t ideal by any means AND they aren’t getting the much needed social/emotional learning practice because they can’t be with their friends and classmates. It’s hard enough for kids to grasp concepts in a classroom under the close guidance and monitoring of their teacher.

Imagine being a kid who struggles or an individual with special needs. How on earth are these kids expect to succeed!? It’s a HOT-FREAKING-MESS! Kids everywhere are asking Santa and their parents to go back to school. I don’t know about you, but NEVER did I want or ask for that when I was a kid (ironic I went into teaching, right?

Lol). I looked forward to going to school to see my friends. Folks, the kids are even burnt out and struggling. We all need to learn and understand the importance of Me Time just so we can survive at this point.

# Your Me Time

Everyone is burned out and we don’t know when things will “return to normal.” With that being said, we can’t control everything, but we are in control of our own lives and what we do with them. It’s time to take care of yourself. Understand the importance of Me Time. Take at least 30 minutes each and everyday to do something for yourself.

I’m not saying you have to book a weekend at the spa (that’d be nice, wouldn’t it?). Since that’s not an option for most people, work with what you’ve got. Below is a list of things you can do during Me Time:

- Read a book

- Go for a walk

- Exercise

- Meditate

- Color (my favorite thing to do)

- Call a friend

- Journal

- Do a puzzle

- Listen to a podcast

- Take a bath

- Watch a tv show or movie

- Dance

- Sing

- Play an instrument

- Draw

- Do arts & crafts

- Cool or bake (if you find it relaxing like me)

- Organize (I know I’m not the only weirdo out there who gets a sick satisfaction from a freshly organized

Do not underestimate the importance of Me Time. Use your Me Time to recharge. You can’t run on empty for an extended period of time. Add it into your schedule somehow. You can do your 30 minutes all at once or you can break it up. Doesn’t matter which one. Just get the importance of Me Time in your head and take action. It’s for your overall health.

# Make It A Priority

This is important. Schedule it in your calendar on your phone with an alert if you need to do so. Just make sure you get it done daily. Remember what they say on flights about safety masks, always put yours on before helping others. Your health, my friends, is like that safety mask. It’s not unreasonable to take time out for yourself.

Don’t feel guilty. Do it. You DESERVE it! If you’re not at your best, then how can you help others be their best?
