Ever find yourself frustrated in feeling full and killing cravings? Wonder how filling is the food you’re eating? Let’s back track real quick … Why do we eat? We eat to live, right? Right! Now I think it’s fair to say (on behalf of the human experience) we also eat to have a dance party in our stomach. Can I get a hell freakin’ yeah on that?

So how do we solve this eat for a dance party while feeling satisfied to the max problem? What is the secret to filling ourselves like a bucket of water all while hosting a dance party in our stomachs (haha)?

# The Secret = Protein

Protein is a godsend for satiation. In fact, it’s not only integral for feeling full, it also helps melt fat, build lean muscle, and increase your sex game. If you’re on the go turkey wraps, beef jerky, healthy protein bars with fiber are an AWESOME option vs. your muffin, doughnut, cake bite, or pastry. Those are high in calories, non fulfilling and aid fat storage in the midsection.

One thing I want to make sure I point out is that protein does NOT just mean meat. There are plant- based protein sources, such as asparagus, broccoli, pumpkin seeds, hemp seeds, sunflower seeds, beans, quinoa, peas, lentils, chia seeds, oatmeal, flax seeds, edamame, chickpeas, almonds, spirulina, black berries, black eyed peas, almond butter, hazelnuts, etc.

In an ideal world, we would all be eating at least 100 grams of protein per day. I know that sounds a little daunting though so let’s start by sneaking some protein into your morning and and/or afternoon snack. Below is a list of snacks loaded with protein that I incorporate into my days regularly. Give them a try:

- almonds (Blue Diamond’s Smokehouse flavor and Wasabi Soy Sauce are my faves)

- roasted chickpeas

- protein bars (preferably RX Bars, Quest, or Oh Yeah One! bars — lots of the other ones out there are glorified candy bars so be careful. Check the nutritional label!)

- protein shake (I like Prestige Labs’ vanilla and chocolate — refer.prestigelabs.com/?af=piqkxjzl)

- protein energy bites

- 0% Greek yogurt

- cottage cheese

- protein pudding (protein powder + Greek yogurt)

- chia pudding

- canned tuna or salmon

- edamame with a little salt & coconut aminos

- roasted turkey deli meat

- hard boiled eggs (best with a little hot sauce on top if you ask me)

- egg muffins

- peanut butter or almond butter on celery or apple

- healthy dill dip with veggies (ask me for the recipe, it’s AMAZING!)

- hummus with veggies

- jerky

- trail mix (WITHOUT dried fruits, but has a little dark chocolate)

# Filling Carbs

I get it, protein might not make your heart leap. But chances are if I say the word carbs, that’s a different story! However, we need to work on getting the right kind of carbs in and the wrong ones out. As delicious as some may be (I’m looking at you cookies, cakes, chips, etc), they simply just don’t serve your body well.

Those types of carbs are not healthy or filling because of all the processed and refined sugars. If you LOVE carbs then homemade oil-free popcorn is a great option! Fruits are awesome, but most of the time fruits won’t help you to feel full. Try adding in a grain or healthy nut for maximum satisfaction and fullness.

# Where to Start?

Feeling a bit overwhelmed? Don’t worry, let’s break it down to make it more manageable. Firstly, it is ideal to have protein at every meal and snack while limiting carbs to just your breakfast and lunch; however, nutrient timing takes practice. Start by making some small adjustments. When sitting down for dinner try to avoid white refined bread, pasta, or potato chips.

While they may start a dance in your belly they won’t help you feel full and that’s not helping anyone right? Sweet potatoes, quinoa, oats and fiber dense carb sources will get the dance party going + make you feel full. WIN WIN!
