Just like shopping, you want to get the best bang for your buck when it comes to nutrition. You want to maximize nutrient absorption. Let’s talk about go over how to do this with some vegan friendly tips. Even if you aren’t vegan, these tips can help your body OPTIMIZE its ability to absorb nutrients.

# PAIRING FOODS

Pairing certain foods with others helps the food’s nutrients absorb more effectively. This is key since the nutrients in these foods on their own aren’t as readily available. On their own, there aren’t as readily available, but if you pair them with another, they can actually be enhanced.

Here we will focus on three key pairings: iron and vitamin C, unsaturated fats and vitamins A, D, E, and K and calcium and vitamin D.

- IRON & VITAMIN C : Pair your dark leafy greens with a source of vitamin C such as citrus fruits, capsicum or tomato in the same meal. This combination will help to enhance the amount of iron that can be absorbed within the body.

- UNSATURATED FATS + VITAMINS A, D, E & K: Vitamins A, D, E and K are fat-soluble. In order for them to absorb in the body, they must be consumed with a source of fat. Consume healthy unsaturated fats like avocado, nuts, seeds or olive oil with things such as carrots and broccoli.

- CALCIUM & VITAMIN D: These two nutrients work together to help build and strengthen your bones. Consume plant-based calcium sources in adequate amounts (such as calcium-fortified plant milks) and ensure that you get at least 10-15 minutes of sun exposure every day.
