              Dave has a confident and seasoned grasp of all of the technical aspects of high-level training. But, in addition and, perhaps more important for his clients, he possesses that critical instinct for those moments in a workout where effort meets resistance in the most productive way possible. Dave is keenly attuned to the "Zen" of the training session. To work with him is to experience intense focus – one's own and also his. Plus, I grew some better-than-average guns.
